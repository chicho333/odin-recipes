This project is a test for all the skills I've learnt so far while learning
HTML coding in "The Odin Project", so everything in this basic recipe website
is for the mere purpose of showcasing and practice my HTML skills.

I will have worked in both working with working directly with git from the text editor. Using HTML elements such as headliners, paragraphs, bold and italics texts, comments in the code, ordered and unordered lists, anchor elements and attributes, linking to relative links, showcasing images and using alt attributes, and both productive and useful git commit messages.
